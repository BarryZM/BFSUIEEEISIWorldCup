    First we'll drop rows that empty value is too many.
    This table has too many empty values, but they should be indicating the number is 0 or not published
    instead of dirty value. We want the counted number of each company, so we don't drop rows here.
    We don't drop data in this table, just replace them with 0.
    Then we check nulls column by column and decide how to process with it.
    Next we should numeric all the value for future process.
    After these are done, it's time to work out features we can use in this table which belongs
        to exploratory data analysis.
